 * An exception that is thrown when something has not been implemented yet but is scheduled to be.
 * This is supposed to replace the NotImplementedException and UnsupportedOperationException
 * It replaces the former one because it is an internal Oracle API
 * And it replaces the latter one, because it is not specific enough and can be used for other meanings as well
