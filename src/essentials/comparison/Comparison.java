 * @implNote There are several reasons why ComparisonResult is a class and not an integer.<br>
 * A set of fixed int instances are assignable as return values and allow an intuitive use within code.<br>
 * As such, they can be used as more readable return types for comparisons.<br>
 * Also enums provide the illusion that only 3 valid comparison results exist in Java.<br>
 * In fact, every negative value is considered smaller and every positive number is considered greater.<br>
 * Therefore, it would be wrong to have an enumeration of comparison results encompass only 3 values.
